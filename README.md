- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ronchoke
- 👀 I have many interests that I would love to share, arts, crafts, sailing and the most recent is programming!  
      I mean, who would have thought that *I* would **LOVE** programming?! Nah, You know what I'm talking about! 😉
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development, in Python and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source code development and reviewing, website & app development, and anything cool that I can contribute to 🤗
